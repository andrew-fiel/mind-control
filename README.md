# Mind-Controlled Media

Web app with a Flask backend that uses PRAW to make posts to the reddit API. Has a password-protected front end for demos and debugging.

Intended to be used in conjunction with a modified Star Wars Force Trainer headset in order to make the length of reddit posts vary.

The content of the posts comes from Markov Chains based on CSU's cs370 lecture slides.

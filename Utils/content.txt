Moore’s law is dead ?  / not dead ?  Called  " Moore’s Law "   Microprocessors have become smaller ,  denser ,  and more powerful .

The three sections are graded independently .   Colorado State University  Grading Policy   Letter grades will be based on the following standard breakpoints   I will not cut higher than this ,  but I may cut lower .    There will be no make - up exams   Except for documented  -  required university event  -  acceptable family or medical emergency  Colorado State University  16  grading   Plan: Every programming assignment will be posted 12 -  14 days before the due date .  Written assignments will be posted 6 - 7 days before due date .    Every assignment will include specifications and will indicate it will be graded .    Late submission penalty: 20% for the 24 hours and a ZERO thereafter .    Detailed submission instructions posted on course website .   Plan: Assignments will be graded within 2 weeks of submission  Colorado State University  17  what will Quizzes   I will only ask questions about what I teach ,  or ask you to study ,   If I didn’t teach it ,  I won’t ask from that portion   Some on - line quiz questions about current state of technology may require you to search for an answer on the web   If the concepts were covered in my lectures/slides/assignments  You should be able to answer the questions  You should be able to apply the concepts   I will try to avoid questions about arcane aspects of some device controllers etc .    Colorado State University  One mid - term  The final exam is comprehensive ,  but more emphasis on the later part  Quizzes: An on - line quiz almost every week .  Iclicker interaction session time to time .   Programming written assignments  Occasional help - sessions Wednesday Including coming week   Attend or view recordings  ( required )   Self exercises: Do them yourselves  Colorado State University   Group based   Second half of the semester  Opﬁons  Research paper on current/developing technology  -  Paper ,  presentation ,  poster - session  ( dept )   -  Suggested topics will be announced   Development  -  IoT/Embedded system with sensor/communication  -  Design and evaluation needed  -  Demo presentations  Colorado State University  Electronic devices in lecture room Use of Laptops and other electronic devices are not permitted .

You must be present during the complete class  Assignments have to be done by yourself individually .  We will check .   Expect to work at least 6 - 8 hours per week outside of class   Designing ,  coding and testing programs   Reviewing material from class   Do research for the project  Concentrate in the class .  The class have many new terms and concepts .   Colorado State University Expert view on How to fail this class ?   Believing that you can learn via osmosis  Missing lectures    " If you don’t have the discipline to show up ,  you will most likely not have the discipline to catch up "    Procrastinating  Get started on the assignments late .  Note that they incorporate new concepts ,  including multiple processes and threads .
